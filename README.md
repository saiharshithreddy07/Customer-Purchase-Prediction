# 📊 Customer Purchase Prediction Model

## Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will purchase a high-value product (e.g., a luxury car) based on their **Age** and **Estimated Salary**. It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to identify non-linear buying patterns in customer data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Model:** Random Forest (Switched from Logistic Regression for higher accuracy)

## 📈 Results
* **Accuracy:** ~91%
* **Key Insight:** The model successfully identifies a specific "sweet spot" of age and income where users are highly likely to convert, which standard linear models missed.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Open the `Customer_Purchase_Prediction.ipynb` file in this repository.
2.  Run the cells to see the Data Preprocessing, Model Training, and Visualization steps.
